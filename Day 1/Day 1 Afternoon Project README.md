#  Star Wars Profile

In this project, you will build out a profile for your favorite Star Wars character. You will do this by creating variables or constants (whichever is most appropriate) of their personal details. 

To find details for your favorite Star Wars characters, I reccomend you use https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/ and then type the character name in the search bar at the top. If you cannot find some of the details, that is okay.

### Part One - Basic Character Details

For the following, think about what Type should be used and whether a variabble or a constant would be best.

* create a variable or a constant and set it equal to your characters first name.
* create a variable or a constant and set it equal to your characters last name.
* create a variable or a constant and set it equal to your characters birth date (or creation date). Note, because Star Wars characters cross over two different eras, all dates will have an "ABY" or "BBY" after the number. Factor this in when choosing your type.
* create a variable or constant and set it equal to your characters homeworld.
* create a variable or constant and set it equal to your characters species.
* create a variable or constant and set it equal to your characters gender.
* create a variable or constant and set it equal to your characters height (in meters). Be precise.
* create a variable or constant and set it equal to your characters weight (in kilograms).

### Part Two - Character Status - "It's Complicated..."

For the second part of this project, we are going to capture some values that are a little more complicated. The answers to the following questions may change depending on where you are looking in a characters story arch. So, if controversial, feel free to use your opinion when answering. And of course, be prepared to defend your decisions :)

* create a variable or constant to represent whether or not your charcter appeared in the original trilogy (episodes 4, 5, 6). Think about how you name this.
* create a variable or constant to represent whether or not your charcter appeared in the prequel trilogy (episodes 1, 2, 3).
* create a variable or constant to represent whether or not your charcter appeared in the final trilogy (episodes 7, 8, 9).
* create a variable or a constant to represent whether or not your character was a Jedi Knight.
* create a variable or a constant to represent whether or not your character was a Sith Lord.

### Part Three - Your Opinion

For the final part of this project, you are going to share your opinion of this character as well as how well they were portrayed, and why this character is your favorite.

* create a variable or constant to represnt how important your character was to the Star Wars franchise. An example of your value could be "crucial" or "unimportant".
* create a variabble or a constant showing your overall rating (out of 10) of the preformance by your characters actor/actress. If your character was not portrayed by an actor or actress give them a zero.
* create a variable or constant which holds a value of a brief reason why this charcter is your favorite character.
