#  IOS Prep Course Orientation

Good morning everyone! I am so glad to be getting started with all of you.

I wanted to start off this morning with an orientation of sorts. A small one, becasue we will have a full-orientation next week. 

Then we will take a couple minutes to introduce ourselves. Nothing fancy, just our preferred names so we know what to call one another and where we live, because I think it is really cool how we can connect like this from all over the country, and because it is very helpful for me to know what timezones everyone is in.

So, with that being said, let's jump into it!
- We will do all of our lessons on goToMeeting.
- Almost all of our communication will be through Discord.
- If you are planning on being a part of IOS36 which starts next Monday, and you are not on the IOS Discord Server, please send me a DM saying you need to be added. I will make sure you get that invitation today.
- For this week, we will be on the IOS Prep Course Server.
- You will notice a few different type of channels. Let me go over them:
1) Text Channels - as it sounds, a place where messages happen. The general channel is a place to make general comments. The queue channel is an important one! This is where you need to request help with your afternoon projects. Simply ask for help, state what breakout room you are in, and tag @instructor, @guest instructor and @student mentor. The announcements channel is basically for any announcements we have and where our end of day surveys will populate. 
2) Voice Channels - These voice channels will be used if you need to have a conversation with an instructor. 
3) Breakout Rooms - This is where you will work on your afternoon projects. Please be in one of these rooms until the day is over. This will allow for us to jump in there with you, see how things are going, and offer help if we feel necessary.

That sums up Discord. Let's go ahead and check our security settings for GoToMeeting and Discord:
1) Open up your System Preferences
2) Click on Security & Privacy
3) Click on Camera - Make sure GoToMeeting and Discord are both checked off. If not, click on the lock button at the bottom left to unlock your preferences, then check both off, and re-click the lock.
4) Click on Microphone - Make sure GoToMeeting and Discord are both checked off. If not, click on the lock button at the bottom left to unlock your preferences, then check both off, and re-click the lock.
5) Click on Screen Recording - Make sure GoToMeeting and Discord are both checked off. If not, click on the lock button at the bottom left to unlock your preferences, then check both off, and re-click the lock.

Awesome. Now let's talk about what each day is going to look like and Canvas.

At Devmountain we conform to the teaching methodology called Flipped Learning. This means you will do learning on your own, and then with an instructor. This will allow you to come to class with questions and concerns that you can ask the instructor to specifically speak into.

This means that each day you will have pre-class work. This will include readings, code, and videos. Please make it a priority to complete this pre-class work. It makes a big difference!

To help you with this, you will notice that each day on Canvas has a pre-class module and a module for the day itself. Note, canvas will not let you move on until the prior work has been completed. There is also day/time locks on the different modules.

The modules for the day include your afternoon project, and then your end of day assessment (10 questions). Make sure you submit your afternoon project and take your assessment by 11:59pm. It is my reccomendation that you finish your afternoon project before taking the end of day assessment.

The general layout of you day should look like:
- Night before -> Pre-class work
- 9-12:30 -> Lesson
- 12:30-1:30 -> Lunch
- 1:30-5:00 -> Afternoon project (start on next days pre-class work if time allows).

The last thing I want to mention is that everyone in this room is coming here from different levels of experience. Some people here are already professional developers trying to add to their capabilities. Others haven't coded a day in their lives. Do not compare yourself to one another. You will only make yourself feel bad. Note, we are paying attention to how you are doing, and we will do everything we can to keep you up to pace. If you feel like you are falling too far behind, talk to one of your instructors or your SEM.

Okay. Let's introduce ourselves to one another, share where we live, and then get into the day!
